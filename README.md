This repo is to check some of my hypothesis regarding prime tuples with multiple modulo.
And the space not covered by them in virtually probabilistic sense.

The input configuration is as follows:
1. first line is number of inputs(a single natural number)
2. Then all inputs are provided one after another without a linegap
3. each input is as follows:
    * first line of input is total number of coprimes to be provided for that input
    * then each line will consist of 2 number: first the coprime then the number of modulus separated by a space

An example of such input is as follows,

2
2
5 2
7 2
3
6 3
11 4
13 5

As you can see, above example provides 2 inputs.
